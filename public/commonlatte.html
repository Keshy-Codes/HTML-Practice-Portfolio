 <h1>Most Common Latte Flavors</h1>
    <h2>Based on my observations only</h2>
<hr />
        <h3>Caramel Machiatto</h3>
            <p>I think no cafe that has none of this flavor,a staple for Filipino taste indeed!</p>
        <h3>Classic Iced Latte/ Spanish Latte</h3>
            <p>This is two different flavors but I put as one as I'm not fan of both; the classic is mild flavor while the Spanish is too milky flavor.</p>
        <h3>Mocha Latte</h3>
            <p>For the chocolate lovers out there. However, not all cafes have greate chocolatey taste</p>
